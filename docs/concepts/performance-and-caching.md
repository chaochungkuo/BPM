# Performance & Caching

Key points:
- Rendering: aim for minimal file generation and reuse immutable assets.
- Cache: leverage store cache; avoid large binary duplication inside templates.
- Incrementality: detect existing outputs when safe; document when to force rerun.
- Large data: stream where possible; avoid deep directory traversals in hooks.

TODO:
- Offer patterns for cacheâ€‘aware templates.
- Note environment variables or flags that control cache behavior.
