# Hooks & Adapters

Key points:
- Hook points: pre‑render, post‑render, pre‑run, post‑run.
- Use cases: environment activation, input validation, output collection, cleanup.
- Location: hooks live alongside templates/workflows or in shared directories.

TODO:
- Show a basic hook implementation and how BPM discovers it.
- List common adapter patterns (modules, conda, containers).
