# Workflow Anatomy

Key points:
- Descriptor: `workflow.yaml` declares params, files to render, `run.entry`, and optional publish keys.
- Composition: may call multiple tools/steps; can shell out to engines.
- Outputs: aggregate artifacts and expose via publish keys.

TODO:
- Provide a minimal `workflow.yaml` skeleton.
- Describe how to share params across steps.
