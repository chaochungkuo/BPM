# Distribution Models

Key points:
- Local: point BPM at a local directory (fast for development).
- Git: add via HTTPS/SSH; pin tags or commits for stability.
- Multiâ€‘store: operate multiple catalogs; switch active store per project.
- Trust: review sources; prefer signed releases where possible.

TODO:
- Show `bpm resource add` examples for local and Git.
- Note how version/commit info is recorded in cache.
