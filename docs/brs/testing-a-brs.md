# Testing a BRS

Key points:
- Smoke tests: render templates with minimal params; assert expected files.
- Golden files: compare rendered outputs to versionâ€‘controlled fixtures.
- CI: run tests on push; validate params and publish resolvers.
- Linting: enforce naming conventions and structure with simple scripts.

TODO:
- Provide an example test layout and commands.
- Add a checklist for reviewing template quality.
